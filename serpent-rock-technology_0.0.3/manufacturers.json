		"description": "This manufacturer represents possession of and/or permission to make use of the KĒTŎS frame, the ancient station on the island of Serpent Rock it was discovered within, and the unique NHP, also called KĒTŎS, which is encased within it. Mechanically, it can be treated as a supplement to the GMS gear, weaponry, systems, and frames that is only available to one player who is resident on the moon of Life in the Orb system and who has been granted the privilege of access and use. Note that while mechanically it is expected that the pilot of KĒTŎS will always be able to perform a Full Repair as described in the rules, because of its nature the GM may require the player to provide an entertaining explanation as to how KĒTŎS is repaired in situations with reduced resources or little access to appropriate facilities."
